2. **Maturity** — is it stable and well-maintained?
3. **Community** — is there active community support?
4. **Performance** — benchmarks and real-world performance data
5. **Maintenance burden** — what's the ongoing cost of adoption?
6. **Alternatives** — what else exists and why is this option better?
