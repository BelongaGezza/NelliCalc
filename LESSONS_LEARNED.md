## Build & Tooling (001-099)

### LESSON-001: Android Gradle NDK auto-install failures (InstallFailedException)

**Category:** Build & Tooling  
**Date:** 2026-03-20  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Sprint:** sprint-003-calculator-engine (Android / IDE)

**Problem:**  
The Java/Gradle IDE integration reported `InstallFailedException` for NDK `28.2.13676358` during project configuration, even when the NDK was already present under `ANDROID_SDK/ndk/<version>`. Gradle’s automatic SDK component install can fail (permissions, SDK Manager, or offline use).

**Solution:**  
1. Set `android.builder.sdkDownload=false` in `android/gradle.properties` so Gradle does not attempt to auto-download SDK/NDK packages.  
2. Add an explicit **`ndk.dir`** in `android/local.properties` (gitignored) pointing at the side-by-side NDK folder, e.g. `ndk.dir=/path/to/Android/Sdk/ndk/28.2.13676358`. This often stops AGP from invoking SDK Manager install when the NDK is already on disk.  
3. Install required components manually if needed: Android Studio → SDK Manager → SDK Tools → NDK, or `sdkmanager "ndk;28.2.13676358"`.  
4. Copy `android/local.properties.example` to `android/local.properties` and adjust paths.

**Prevention:**  
Document local Android setup for contributors; keep Flutter’s expected NDK version aligned with `flutter.ndkVersion` / Flutter release notes.

## Security & Safety (700-799)

### LESSON-700: Defensive parsing for persisted JSON (HistoryEntry.fromJson)

**Category:** Security & Safety  
**Date:** 2026-02-14  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Sprint:** sprint-002-architecture (security review)

**Problem:**  
`HistoryEntry.fromJson` uses direct casts and `DateTime.parse` without validation. When persistence is implemented (Sprint 004), corrupted or tampered storage can cause uncaught exceptions on load and crash the app or leave history in a bad state.

**Solution:**  
In the data layer (e.g. `LocalHistoryRepository.loadAll()`), decode the stored list in a try/catch. When iterating list elements, call a safe parser (e.g. try/catch per element or a `HistoryEntry.tryFromJson` that returns `null` on invalid input). Skip invalid entries and log; do not let a single bad entry crash the app.

**Prevention:**  
For any model that deserialises from storage or network, use defensive parsing: validate types and required keys, handle null/missing fields, and catch parse exceptions at the boundary. See security review: `docs/security-review-sprint-002.md`.

### LESSON-701: Security review checklist for future sprints

**Category:** Security & Safety  
**Date:** 2026-02-14  
**Severity:** Low  
**Sprint:** sprint-002-architecture (security review)

**Problem:**  
Several low-severity items should be addressed in later sprints to maintain security posture: expression input validation, user-facing error messages, dependency audit in CI, and PoC code in the release bundle.

**Solution:**  
- **Sprint 003:** Engine must accept only allowed expression characters (digits, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `.`, `(`, `)`, whitespace); keep `CalculatorError.message` user-safe (no stack traces or paths).  
- **CI:** Add a step that runs `dart pub outdated` (and vulnerability checks when available).  
- **Pre-release:** Remove or guard `lib/poc/` so it is not included in production builds.

**Prevention:**  
Re-run the Security Specialist checklist (data storage, input validation, dependencies, permissions, platform config, error handling) at the end of each release phase. Reference `docs/security-review-sprint-002.md` and `.agents/security-specialist.md`.

## Project-Specific (900-999)
