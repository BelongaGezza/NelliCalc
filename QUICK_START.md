# Quick Start — NelliCalc

This guide will help you get started with NelliCalc development. The exact setup steps will depend on the selected tech stack, which is currently under evaluation.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites will be required once the tech stack is selected:

### For Flutter (if selected)
- Flutter SDK (latest stable)
- Dart SDK
- Xcode (for iOS development)
- Android Studio (for Android development)

### For React Native (if selected)
- Node.js and npm/yarn
- React Native CLI
- Xcode (for iOS development)
- Android Studio (for Android development)

### For Other Stacks
- Requirements will be documented once the tech stack decision is made

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BelongaGezza/NelliCalc.git
   cd NelliCalc
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Instructions will be provided once the tech stack is selected

3. **Build the project:**
   - Instructions will be provided once the tech stack is selected

4. **Run tests:**
   - Instructions will be provided once the tech stack is selected

5. **Start development:**
   - Check [PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md) for current sprint
   - Review active sprint file in [SPRINTS/](SPRINTS/)
   - Follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development guidelines

## Development Workflow

This project uses a sprint-based development workflow:

1. Check [PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md) for the current sprint
2. Review the active sprint file in [SPRINTS/](SPRINTS/)
3. Claim a role from the Role Assignment Table in the sprint file
4. Complete assigned tasks
5. Submit a Pull Request
